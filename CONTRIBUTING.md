   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use SwiftUI best practices and modern Swift features
- Prefer Swift Concurrency (async/await) over completion handlers
- Keep files under 250 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Architecture Patterns
- **MVVM**: Use SwiftUI patterns with `@State`, `@Observable`, `@Query`
- **SwiftData**: Leverage `@Model` for persistence, `@Query` for data fetching
- **Design System**: Utilize existing `DS` components for consistency
- **Privacy-First**: No third-party analytics, local-only AI processing
- **Localization**: All strings must support 5 languages (EN, IT, ES, FR, DE)
- **Sync Architecture**: CloudKit + App Groups for seamless device sync

### Comment Guidelines
- All comments and documentation must be in English
- Use `// MARK:` for code organization
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Include TODO/FIXME comments with context

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Use Swift Testing framework for business logic
- **UI Tests**: Cover critical user flows and accessibility
- **Integration Tests**: Verify CloudKit sync, widget updates, watch connectivity
- **Localization Tests**: Test in all 5 supported languages
- **Device Testing**: Test on physical iPhone and Apple Watch
- **Performance Tests**: Monitor memory usage and battery impact

- **French (fr)** - Native localization
- **German (de)** - Complete German support

### Adding New Languages
1. **App Localization**
   - Create new `.lproj` folder in `Resources/`
   - Copy `en.lproj/Localizable.strings` as template
   - Translate all strings maintaining key format
   - Update Info.plist for new language support

2. **App Store Localization**
   - Create new language folder in `fastlane/metadata/`
   - Copy `en-US/` metadata structure
   - Translate app description, keywords, release notes
   - Add localized screenshots

3. **Testing**
   - Test with new language device setting
   - Verify widget text updates correctly
   - Test Siri integration in new language
   - Check text truncation and layout

4. **Documentation**
