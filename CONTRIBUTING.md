- Familiarity with SwiftUI and SwiftData
- Basic understanding of CloudKit (for sync features)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mirror-smoker.git
   cd mirror-smoker
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open MirrorSmokerStopper.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure development team**
   - Select your development team in project settings
   - Update bundle identifiers if needed for testing

4. **Build and test**
   - Build the project (‚åò+B)
   - Run tests (‚åò+U)
   - Test on device/simulator

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use SwiftUI best practices and modern Swift features
- Prefer Swift Concurrency (async/await) over completion handlers
- Keep files under 250 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Architecture Patterns
- **MVVM**: Use SwiftUI's built-in patterns with `@State`, `@Observable`, etc.
- **SwiftData**: Use `@Query` and `@Model` for data management
- **Design System**: Use the existing `DS` (Design System) components
- **Localization**: All user-facing strings must be localized

### Comment Guidelines
- All comments and documentation must be in English
- Use `// MARK:` for code organization
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Include TODO/FIXME comments with context

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality using Swift Testing
- Include UI tests for critical user flows
- Test on both iOS and watchOS when applicable
- Verify CloudKit sync functionality
